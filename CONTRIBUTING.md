### Submitting a Pull Request
Our current protected branch is `main`. All PR branches will be merged to the branch `develop`.

When making a PR, set the base to `develop`. 

Then write a description of what changes are expected in the PR and how to test it. 

PRs need to be reviewed and approved by atleast 1 person. Stale approvals when new commits are pushed are dimissed.
